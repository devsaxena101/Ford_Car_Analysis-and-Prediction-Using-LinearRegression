# 🚗# Ford_Car_Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-LinearRegression


## 📌 Overview

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning workflow on a Ford car dataset. The notebook covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to estimate car prices based on key attributes.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and build a reliable regression model that can predict vehicle prices accurately.

## 📊 Key Insights

* Price is strongly influenced by year, mileage, and engine size.
* Newer cars generally have higher prices.
* Higher mileage tends to reduce car value.
* Engine size shows positive correlation with price.
